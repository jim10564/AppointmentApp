# Programming Project 1 – Inheritance and Runtime Polymorohism in Java

# Objective

The objective of this Programming Project is to apply the concept of inheritance and runtime Polymorphism in Java.  

### Program Description

Project includes superclass **Appointment** and subclasses **OneTime, Daily, and Monthly**. An Appointment has a description (for example “see the dentist”) and a date. The method:

**occursOn(int year, int month, int day)**

that checks whether the appointment occurs on that date. For example, for a monthly appointment, the program checks whether the day of the month matches.
You must write following classes:

• Appointment.java
• Daily.java
• Monthly.java
• OneTime.java
